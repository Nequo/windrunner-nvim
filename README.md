# Windrunner

Windrunner is a minimal colorscheme based on [Fogbell](https://github.com/jaredgorski/fogbell.vim)

## Design

The theme simply uses `vim.api.nvim_set_hl` to set highlight colors and does not aim to provide any customisability.
Color is only used for non-syntax elements such as LSP Diagnostics, search and menus.
